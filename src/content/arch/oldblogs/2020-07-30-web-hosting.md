You may have noticed I'm now using a custom domain; [forgenst.com](https://forgenst.com). I've been
using Cloudflare to point my domain and subdomains to my various websites.

1. [forgenst.com](https://forgenst.com) -> Hosted on Firebase
2. [blog.forgenst.com](https://blog.forgenst.com) -> Hosted on GitHub Pages
3. [eapm.forgenst.com](https://eapm.forgenst.com) -> Hosted on Firebase

I've also got free email with [Zoho](https://mail.zoho.com/orgsignup.do) too!
