You may have noticed I've added a commenting system. It's made by [utterances](https://utteranc.es), and it's great. The one problem is that you need a GitHub account to use it. So I started trying to find another solution. After ages of trying to get multiple systems to work, deploying quite a few apps via Heroku and Firebase, I've now given up. None of them worked. So for now, you need a GitHub account to make a comment. But at least you know why.
