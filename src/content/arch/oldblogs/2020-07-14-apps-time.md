This page will probably be constantly updated as I add more apps. For more details, head to [my website](https://forgenst.com/workflow).

## Notetaking
Mostly I use [Notion](https://notion.so), but I'm beginning to use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) more. I store my Obsidian notes on GitHub. I like Notion becuase it stores all my notes in one place, and it has a good structuring system. I like Obsidian because it's more simplistic, and also gives me a graph view.

## Text Editors
I use [Atom](https://atom.io) as my text editor. I did use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for a while, but I don't like it's interface; Atom is more minimalist.
