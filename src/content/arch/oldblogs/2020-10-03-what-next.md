My websites have undergone some changes since I last posted here.

- forgenst.com - now built on Docusaurus
- status.forgenst.com - new
- lunchbenching.forgenst.com - new

I'm thinking about rebuilding forgenst.com (again!) with GatsbyJS, and maybe closing this blog down and merging it with forgenst.com.
