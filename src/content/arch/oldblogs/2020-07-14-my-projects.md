Hi,
My Main Project at the moment is building my website and this blog! I've used html, css and some javascript to make the website, which is based on a template by [Awa](https://codewithawa.com). This blog is built on Jekyll. Both are hosted on GitHub, using GitHub Pages.

And now there's [Zadok](https://blog.forgenst.com/zadok) too!

Anyway, I hope this is interesting,
forgenst
